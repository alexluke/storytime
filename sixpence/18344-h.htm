<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p><big><span class='red'>W</span></big>hether the Poet undertook
to write and SING A SONG
OF SIXPENCE for that popular
price is not stated in his simple
rhyme, but, at all events, we learn that he started
with "a pocket full," and proceeded to draw on
his imagination for all it was worth. What
that famous blackbird-pie really cost&mdash;except in black-birds&mdash;is
not disclosed, though the King seemed
to show some anxiety about the state of his treasury,
as he was discovered "in his counting house"
imediately after the feast. But while the Queen,
regardless of expense, regales herself on "bread and
honey" in "the parlour", and her Maid-of-honour, or
perhaps of-all-work, is engaged at the clothes-line,
nothing is said about a princess.</p>

<p>No doubt there was a princess, and that Princess
might have been PRINCESS BELLE-ETOILE?
Anyway here she is in the same
boat&mdash;I mean book&mdash;and certainly her adventures
are romantic enough to prevent any surprise at
the company in which Her Highness now finds
herself.</p>

<p>Even princesses cannot do without Alphabets,
and so in her train comes AN ALPHABET in
which will be discovered many OLD and tried
FRIENDS of the Nursery.</p>

<p>Thus we launch another volume of our series,
like a fairy ship with a rather mixed cargo,
in the hope that&mdash;to change the metaphor&mdash;like the
blackbird-pie, it may prove, when opened, to be "a
pretty dish to set before&mdash;" their Babyships.</p>

<h3>PRINCESS BELLE-ETOILE.</h3>


<p>Once upon a time there were three Princesses, named Roussette,
Brunette, and Blondine, who lived in retirement with their mother, a
Princess who had lost all her former grandeur. One day an old woman
called and asked for a dinner, as this Princess was an excellent cook. After
the meal was over, the old woman, who was a fairy, promised that their
kindness should be rewarded, and immediately disappeared.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the King came that way, with his brother and the Lord
Admiral. They were all so struck with the beauty of the three Princesses,
that the King married the youngest, Blondine, his brother married Brunette,
and the Lord Admiral married Roussette.</p>

<p>The good Fairy, who had brought all this about, also caused the young
Queen Blondine to have three lovely children, two boys and a girl, out
of whose hair fell fine jewels. Each had a brilliant star on the forehead, and
a rich chain of gold around the neck. At the same time Brunette, her sister,
gave birth to a handsome boy. Now the young Queen and Brunette were
much attached to each other, but Roussette was jealous of both, and the old
Queen, the King's mother, hated them. Brunette died soon after the birth
of her son, and the King was absent on a warlike expedition, so Roussette
joined the wicked old Queen in forming plans to injure Blondine. They
ordered Feintise, the old Queen's waiting-woman, to strangle the Queen's
three children and the son of Princess Brunette, and bury them secretly.
But as she was about to execute this wicked order, she was so struck by
their beauty, and the appearance of the sparkling stars on their foreheads,
that she shrank from the deed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;">
<a href="images/024.jpg"><img src="images/024th.jpg" width="345" height="400" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>So she had a boat brought round to the beach, and put the four babes,
with some strings of jewels, into a cradle, which she placed in the boat, and
then set it adrift. The boat was soon far out at sea. The waves rose,
the rain poured in torrents, and the thunder roared. Feintise could not doubt
that the boat would be swamped, and felt relieved by the thought that the poor
little innocents would perish, for she would otherwise always be haunted by
the fear that something would occur to betray the share she had had in
their preservation.</p>

<p>But the good Fairy protected them, and after floating at sea for seven days
they were picked up by a Corsair. He was so struck by their beauty that
he altered his course, and took them home to his wife, who had no children.
She was transported with joy when he placed them in her hands. They
admired together the wonderful stars, the chains of gold that could not be
taken off their necks, and their long ringlets. Much greater was the woman's
astonishment when she combed them, for at every instant there rolled out
of their hair pearls, rubies, diamonds, and emeralds. She told her husband
of it, who was not less surprised than herself.</p>

<p>"I am very tired," said he, "of a Corsair's life, and if the locks of those
little children continue to supply us with such treasures, I will give up
roaming the seas." The Corsair's wife, whose name was Corsine, was
enchanted at this, and loved the four infants so much the more for it. She
named the Princess, Belle-Etoile, her eldest brother, Petit-Soleil, the second,
Heureux, and the son of Brunette, Cheri.</p>

<p>As they grew older, the Corsair applied himself seriously to their education,
as he felt convinced there was some great mystery attached to their birth.</p>

<p>The Corsair and his wife had never told the story of the four children, who
passed for their own. They were exceedingly united, but Prince Cheri entertained
for Princess Belle-Etoile a greater affection than the other two. The
moment she expressed a wish for anything, he would attempt even impossibilities
to gratify her.</p>

<p>One day Belle-Etoile overheard the Corsair and his wife talking. "When
I fell in with them," said the Corsair, "I saw nothing that could give me any
idea of their birth." "I suspect," said Corsine, "that Cheri is not their
brother, he has neither star nor neck-chain." Belle-Etoile immediately ran
and told this to the three Princes, who resolved to speak to the Corsair and
his wife, and ask them to let them set out to discover the secret of their
birth. After some remonstrance they gained their consent. A beautiful
vessel was prepared, and the young Princess and the three Princes set out.
They determined to sail to the very spot where the Corsair had found them,
and made preparations for a grand sacrifice to the fairies, for their protection
and guidance. They were about to immolate a turtle-dove, but the Princess
saved its life, and let it fly. At this moment a syren issued from the water,
and said, "Cease your anxiety, let your vessel go where it will; land where
it stops." The vessel now sailed more quickly. Suddenly they came in sight
of a city so beautiful that they were anxious their vessel should enter the port.
Their wishes were accomplished; they landed, and the shore in a moment
was crowded with people, who had observed the magnificence of their ship.
They ran and told the King the news, and as the grand terrace of the Palace
looked out upon the sea-shore, he speedily repaired thither. The Princes,
hearing the people say, "There is the King," looked up, and made a profound
obeisance. He looked earnestly at them, and was as much charmed by
the Princess's beauty, as by the handsome mien of the young Princes. He
ordered his equerry to offer them his protection, and everything that they
might require.</p>

<p>The King was so interested about these four children, that he went into the
chamber of the Queen, his mother, to tell her of the wonderful stars which
shone upon their foreheads, and everything that he admired in them. She
was thunderstruck at it, and was terribly afraid that Feintise had betrayed
her, and sent her secretary to enquire about them. What he told her of
their ages confirmed her suspicions. She sent for Feintise, and threatened to
kill her. Feintise, half dead with terror, confessed all; but promised, if she
spared her, that she would still find means to do away with them. The Queen
was appeased; and, indeed, old Feintise did all she could for her own sake.
Taking a guitar, she went and sat down opposite the Princess's window,
and sang a song which Belle-Etoile thought so pretty that she invited her
into her chamber. "My fair child," said Feintise, "Heaven has made you
very lovely, but you yet want one thing&mdash;the dancing-water. If I had
possessed it, you would not have seen a white hair upon my head, nor a
wrinkle on my face. Alas! I knew this secret too late; my charms had
already faded." "But where shall I find this dancing-water?" asked Belle-Etoile.
"It is in the luminous forest," said Feintise. "You have three
brothers; does not any one of them love you sufficiently to go and fetch
some?" "My brothers all love me," said the Princess, "but there is one
of them who would not refuse me anything." The perfidious old woman
retired, delighted at having been so successful. The Princes, returning from
the chase, found Belle-Etoile engrossed by the advice of Feintise. Her
anxiety about it was so apparent, that Cheri, who thought of nothing but
pleasing her, soon found out the cause of it, and, in spite of her entreaties,
he mounted his white horse, and set out in search of the dancing-water.
When supper-time arrived, and the Princess did not see her brother Cheri,
she could neither eat nor drink; and desired he might be sought for everywhere,
and sent messengers to find him and bring him back.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The wicked Feintise was very anxious to know the result of her advice;
and when she heard that Cheri had already set out, she was delighted, and
reported to the Queen-Mother all that had passed. "I admit, Madam," said
she, "that I can no longer doubt that they are the same four children: but
one of the Princes is already gone to seek the dancing-water, and will no
doubt perish in the attempt, and I shall find similar means to do away with
all of them."</p>

<p>The plan she had adopted with regard to Prince Cheri was one of the most
certain, for the dancing-water was not easily to be obtained; it was so
notorious from the misfortunes which occurred to all who sought it, that every
one knew the road to it. He was eight days without taking any repose but in
the woods. At the end of this period he began to suffer very much from the
heat; but it was not the heat of the sun, and he did not know the cause of it,
until from the top of a mountain he perceived the luminous forest; all the
trees were burning without being consumed, and casting out flames to such a
distance that the country around was a dry desert.</p>

<p>At this terrible scene he descended, and more than once gave himself up
for lost. As he approached this great fire he was ready to die with thirst; and
perceiving a spring falling into a marble basin, he alighted from his horse,
approached it, and stooped to take up some water in the little golden vase
which he had brought with him, when he saw a turtle-dove drowning in
the fountain. Cheri took pity on it, and saved it. "My Lord Cheri," she
said, "I am not ungrateful; I can guide you to the dancing-water, which,
without me, you could never obtain, as it rises in the middle of the forest,
and can only be reached by going underground." The Dove then flew away,
and summoned a number of foxes, badgers, moles, snails, ants, and all sorts
of creatures that burrow in the earth. Cheri got off his horse at the entrance
of the subterranean passage they made for him, and groped his way after
the kind Dove, which safely conducted him to the fountain. The Prince filled
his golden vase; and returned the same way he came.</p>

<p>He found Belle-Etoile sorrowfully seated under some trees, but when she
saw him she was so pleased that she scarcely knew how to welcome him.</p>

<p>Old Feintise learned from her spies that Cheri had returned, and that the
Princess, having washed her face with the dancing-water, had become more
lovely than ever. Finding this, she lost no time in artfully making the Princess
sigh for the wonderful singing-apple. Prince Cheri again found her unhappy,
and again found out the cause, and once more set out on his white horse,
leaving a letter for Belle-Etoile.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the King did not forget the lovely children, and reproached
them for never going to the Palace. They excused themselves by saying that
their brother's absence prevented them.</p>

<p>Prince Cheri at break of day perceived a handsome young man, from
whom he learned where the singing-apple was to be found: but after
travelling some time without seeing any sign of it, he saw a poor turtle-dove
fall at his feet almost dead. He took pity on it, and restored it, when it said,
"Good-day, handsome Cheri, you are destined to save my life, and I to do you
signal service. You are come to seek for the singing-apple: it is guarded
by a terrible dragon." The Dove then led him to a place where he found
a suit of armour, all of glass: and by her advice he put it on, and boldly
went to meet the dragon. The two-headed monster came bounding along,
fire issuing from his throat; but when he saw his alarming figure multiplied
in the Prince's mirrors he was frightened in his turn. He stopped, and
looking fiercely at the Prince, apparently laden with dragons, he took flight
and threw himself into a deep chasm. The Prince then found the tree, which
was surrounded with human bones, and breaking off an apple, prepared to
return to the Princess. She had never slept during his absence, and ran to
meet him eagerly.</p>

<p>When the wicked Feintise heard the sweet singing of the apple, her grief
was excessive, for instead of doing harm to these lovely children, she only did
them good by her perfidious counsels. She allowed some days to pass by
without showing herself; and then once more made the Princess unhappy by
saying that the dancing-water and the singing-apple were useless without
the little green bird that tells everything.</p>

<p>Cheri again set out, and after some trouble learnt that this bird was to be
found on the top of a frightful rock, in a frozen climate. At length, at dawn
of day, he perceived the rock, which was very high and very steep, and upon
the summit of it was the bird, speaking like an oracle, telling wonderful
things. He thought that with a little dexterity it would be easy to catch it,
for it seemed very tame. He got off his horse, and climbed up very quietly.
He was so close to the green bird that he thought he could lay hands on it,
when suddenly the rock opened and he fell into a spacious hall, and became as
motionless as a statue; he could neither stir, nor utter a complaint at his
deplorable situation. Three hundred knights, who had made the same attempt,
were in the same state. To look at each other was the only thing permitted
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a href="images/029.jpg"><img src="images/029th.jpg" width="350" height="400" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The time seemed so long to Belle-Etoile, and still no signs of her beloved
Cheri, that she fell dangerously ill; and in the hopes of curing her, Petit-Soleil
resolved to seek him.</p>

<p>But he too was swallowed up by the rock and fell into the great hall. The
first person he saw was Cheri, but he could not speak to him; and Prince
Heureux, following soon after, met with the same fate as the other two.</p>

<p>When Feintise was aware that the third Prince was gone, she was exceedingly
delighted at the success of her plan; and when Belle-Etoile, inconsolable
at finding not one of her brothers return, reproached herself for their loss,
and resolved to follow them, she was quite overjoyed.</p>

<p>The Princess was disguised as a cavalier, but had no other armour than her
helmet. She was dreadfully cold as she drew near the rock, but seeing a
turtle-dove lying on the snow, she took it up, warmed it, and restored it to
life: and the dove reviving, gaily said, "I know you, in spite of your disguise;
follow my advice: when you arrive at the rock, remain at the bottom and
begin to sing the sweetest song you know; the green bird will listen to you; you
must then pretend to go to sleep; when it sees me, it will come down to peck
me, and at that moment you will be able to seize it."</p>

<p>All this fell out as the Dove foretold. The green bird begged for liberty.
"First," said Belle-Etoile, "I wish that thou wouldst restore my three
brothers to me."</p>

<p>"Under my left wing there is a red feather," said the bird: "pull it out, and
touch the rock with it."</p>

<p>The Princess hastened to do as she was instructed; the rock split from the
top to the bottom: she entered with a victorious air the hall in which stood
the three Princes with many others; she ran towards Cheri, who did not
know her in her helmet and male attire, and could neither speak nor
move. The green bird then told the Princess she must rub the eyes and
mouth of all those she wished to disenchant with the red feather, which good
office she did to all.</p>

<p>The three Princes and Belle-Etoile hastened to present themselves to the
King; and when Belle-Etoile showed her treasures, the little green bird told
him that the Princes Petit-Soleil and Heureux and the Princess Belle-Etoile
were his children, and that Prince Cheri was his nephew. Queen Blondine,
who had mourned for them all these years, embraced them, and the wicked
Queen-Mother and old Feintise were justly punished. And the King, who
thought his nephew Cheri the handsomest man at Court, consented to his
marriage with Belle-Etoile. And lastly, to make everyone happy, the King
sent for the Corsair and his wife, who gladly came.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
